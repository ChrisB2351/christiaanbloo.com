Tony's Chocolonely as a brand focuses on slave free chocolate. After multiple analysis we found that there is a huge gap in the market for vegan chocolate. And why, as a slave free chocolate brand not also focus on sustainability. For this reason we designed a line of vegan chocolate bars for Tony.
