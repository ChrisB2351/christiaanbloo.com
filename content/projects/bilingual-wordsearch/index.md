Inspired by a Portuguese-Dutch word search book I picked up at a train station, I decided to create a digital version that could work with any language pair. This interactive word search game puts a multilingual twist on the classic puzzle format you get hints in one language and then have to hunt for the corresponding words hidden in the grid in another language. 

It's like having a personal language tutor disguised as a fun puzzle game! Whether you're trying to expand your Spanish vocabulary, brush up on French, or tackle any other language combination, this tool adapts to your needs. You can customize everything: input your own vocabulary lists, adjust the grid size, control the difficulty level, and even choose how tricky you want the word placement to be. 

Perfect for language learners who want to practice vocabulary recognition in an engaging way, or anyone who enjoys word puzzles with an educational twist. No more being stuck with pre-made puzzle books now you can create exactly the challenge you need!
