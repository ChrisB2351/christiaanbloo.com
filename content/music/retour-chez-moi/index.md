Retour Chez Moi was composed after coming back from a vacation, hence the title. The melody of the first part repeats later on in the song, but it does not sound the same anymore. The second time it is more nuanced and slightly more complex. It highlights the feeling of coming home and everything feeling the same, yet different.
