Au Fil de la Nuit is the second single of my new EP. The song is a sister song to Une Brise d'Éte, which was the last song of Les Mélodies de la Pluie. This song however is a bit more dramatic. Starting from En Vol, which takes place during the twilight, Au Fil de la Nuit will take us further into the night!
