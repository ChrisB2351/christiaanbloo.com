La Nuit is my second EP. This EP is the follow up EP of Les Mélodies de la pluie. The first and last song have previously been released as singles. The middle two tracks are new. The overall sound of these songs is a bit more aggressive then the previous releases.
It has 4 songs in total:
1. En Vol (In Flight)
2. Les Ombres du Passé (Shadows of the Past)
3. Chemin Caché (Hidden Path)
4. Au Fil de la Nuit (Through the Night)
