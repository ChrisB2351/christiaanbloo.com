<h1>Hi, Nice to meet you!</h1>
Welcome to my website.
I’m Christiaan, a composer, musician, and designer from the Netherlands. I create neo-classical music inspired by everyday moments, emotions, and stories. Beyond music, I also work on design projects, blending creativity and functionality to bring ideas to life.

Here, you can explore my music, find sheet music for compositions like Les Mélodies de la Pluie and La Nuit, and learn more about the projects I’m involved in.

Feel free to look around, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
